# Speaker-Recognition-System

Speaker recognition, also known as voice recognition, is the process of identifying an 
individual based on their vocal characteristics. This technology has found various applications 
in fields such as security, forensics, and personal computing. However, the problem of speaker 
recognition is still challenging, especially in the presence of noise, variations in speech signals, 
and other factors that can affect the quality of speech signals.

The problem of speaker recognition is to determine the identity of a speaker based on their 
speech signal. This involves extracting and analyzing the unique vocal characteristics of a 
speaker to build a speaker model, which can then be used to recognize the speaker. The 
difficulty of this problem is compounded by the presence of noise, variations in speech signals, 
and other factors that can affect the quality of speech signals. 

Speaker recognition has significant practical applications in fields such as security, forensics,
Voice based banking, home automation, and voice recognition-based gadgets are some of the many 
applications of voice recognition and personal computing. For example, speaker recognition can 
be used for secure authentication in financial transactions, where voice biometrics can be used 
to confirm the identity of a speaker before allowing access to sensitive information. In 
forensics, speaker recognition can be used to identify suspects in recorded conversations, and 
in personal computing, speaker recognition can be used for voice-controlled interfaces and 
personal assistants. 

In this voice recognition system, we have used two main techniques: 
1. MFCC 
2. Decision Tree
